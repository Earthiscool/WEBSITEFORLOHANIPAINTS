Social spaces like living rooms and dining areas benefit from warm colors such as reds, oranges, or soft yellows, which create an inviting and energetic atmosphere. For example, a vibrant coral can make a living room feel lively, perfect for entertaining guests. Conversely, bedrooms and study areas call for calming hues like blues, greens, or soft grays to promote relaxation and focus. At our Gaya store, we offer personalized color consultations to help you match your vision to the room’s purpose, ensuring every space feels just right."

In rooms with ample natural light, colors like bright whites or pastels can shine, while darker hues like navy or charcoal may absorb light, creating a cozy feel. In Gaya’s climate, where sunlight can be intense, testing paint samples on your walls is crucial. Apply small patches and observe them at different times of day—morning, afternoon, and evening—to see how they shift. Our premium paints at <strong>Lohani Paints</strong> are formulated to maintain consistent color quality across various lighting conditions, ensuring your chosen shade looks perfect."

Matte finishes are excellent for hiding imperfections on walls but are less durable and harder to clean, making them suitable for low-traffic areas like formal dining rooms. Satin and semi-gloss finishes are ideal for high-traffic spaces like kitchens, bathrooms, or hallways, as they resist stains and are easy to wipe down. Glossy finishes add a dramatic sheen but highlight imperfections, so they’re best for trim or furniture. At <strong>Lohani Paints</strong>, we stock a wide range of finishes, from matte to high-gloss, to meet every need, whether you’re painting interiors or exteriors in Gaya’s variable climate."

For latex or water-based paints, rinse tools thoroughly with warm water and mild soap, working the bristles or nap to remove all paint residue.
